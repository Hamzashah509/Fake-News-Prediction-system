Fake News Prediction System
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for predicting fake news using text data. The system converts textual data into numerical features, processes it, and trains a Logistic Regression model to achieve accurate predictions. The project utilizes Python libraries such as numpy, pandas, nltk, TfidfVectorizer, and more.

Project Overview
Convert text data into numerical features using TfidfVectorizer.
Implement data preprocessing techniques like stemming and removing stopwords.
Train a Logistic Regression model to predict fake news.
Evaluate the model's performance using accuracy score.
Achieved an impressive 95% accuracy in detecting fake news.
